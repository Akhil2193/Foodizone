## Things Learnt and Implemented 
* This project was built using MERN (Mongoose, Express, React JS, Node JS) stack and Material-UI react.
* Created and hosted the database on MongoDB Atlas and rendered  it by creating my own REST API.
* It was my first React JS project. I used React Router for routing of the pages and axios for making requests to Backend.
* Worked with cookies and authentication using Passport.js.
* Learnt more about CORS and resolved some errors related to it.
* Tried to make UI/UX suitable for cross-platform functioning.
* Implemented various components from Material-UI.
* Learnt how to deploy a production build using heroku.
* The search bar is not yet working. There were some errors which I was not able to solve due to the time-constraint, so I removed the entire functioning for the time being.
